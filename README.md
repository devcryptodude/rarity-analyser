# Cool Rarity

Cool Rarity is an open source package for easy rarity score calculation. 

Cool Rarity was born in a [Hackathon](https://github.com/punkscape/01-rarity-analyser-hackathon) hosted by [PunkScape](https://punkscape.xyz/), made with love by [Fukuball](https://twitter.com/fukuball). It is easy to configure for developers and easy to use for users, any NFT collection with [OpenSea metadata stardard](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) can use Cool Rarity as the rarity score calculation tool. If you have the collection metadata in hand, you can depoly Cool Rarity as your collection rarity tool in minues!
